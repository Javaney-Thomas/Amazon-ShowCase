# Amazon-ShowCase
https://clone-b3542.web.app/

This project involved developing a single-page application (SPA) that replicates the core functionalities and design of the Amazon website. Built using React, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, and MaterialUI, the goal was to create a modern, responsive web page that mimics Amazon's user interface and experience.

As a web developer, my focus was on implementing key features such as the product tile display format and the shopping checkout header to closely resemble the original site. The project also served as an opportunity to work with JavaScript and React-specific functionalities, including currency formatting with react-currency-format and web form management. I utilized advanced CSS techniques, such as the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology, to maintain clean and scalable styles throughout the application.
